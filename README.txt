
1.Firstly, run dataset/generate_dataset.py to build dataset.pkl for each PPI.
2.Then, run main.py to reproduce.
Run the command line in a terminal 'python main.py --cacer_type [pancancer or BRCA or LUAD or PRAD or KIRC or LIHC or LUSC or STAD or THCA]' --network [BioGRID or CPDB or HINT or IRefIndex or STRING]

Noticeï¼š If you want to use other cancer types which are not contained in the 16 cancer types, you need to refer the 'data_preprocessing' folder to process omics data or PPI data steps by steps.
Our method covers 16 cancer types and 5 PPI networks (BioGRID, CPDB, HINT, IRefIndex and STRING).
On pan-cancer we compared with existing methods in 5 PPI networks. Specially, we also compared with existing methods on eight single cancers (BRCA, LUAD, PRAD, KIRC, LIHC, LUSC, STAD, and THCA) in five PPI networks as well.
